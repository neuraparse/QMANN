## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a code of conduct that we expect all contributors to follow. Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/QMANN.git
   cd QMANN
   ```
3. **Add the upstream repository**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/bayrameker/QMANN.git
   ```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Git
- Docker (optional, for containerized development)

### Local Development

1. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Install development dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

3. **Install pre-commit hooks**:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

### Docker Development

Alternatively, use Docker for development:

```bash
docker-compose up qmnn-dev
```

This will start a Jupyter Lab environment with all dependencies installed.

## Contributing Guidelines

### Types of Contributions

We welcome several types of contributions:

- **Bug fixes**: Fix issues in the codebase
- **Feature additions**: Add new functionality
- **Documentation improvements**: Enhance or fix documentation
- **Performance optimizations**: Improve code efficiency
- **Test additions**: Add or improve test coverage
- **Examples and tutorials**: Create educational content

### Coding Standards

- **Python Style**: Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- **Code Formatting**: Use `black` for code formatting
- **Import Sorting**: Use `isort` for import organization
- **Type Hints**: Include type hints for all functions and methods
- **Docstrings**: Use Google-style docstrings for all public functions

### Code Quality Tools

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

- **Black**: Code formatting
- **isort**: Import sorting
- **flake8**: Linting
- **mypy**: Type checking
- **pytest**: Testing

Run all quality checks:
```bash
make lint
make test
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the coding standards

3. **Add tests** for new functionality

4. **Update documentation** if necessary

5. **Run tests and quality checks**:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   black src/ tests/
   isort src/ tests/
   flake8 src/ tests/
   mypy src/
   ```

6. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add quantum memory optimization"
   ```

7. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

8. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub

### Pull Request Guidelines

- **Title**: Use a descriptive title following conventional commits format
- **Description**: Provide a clear description of changes
- **Tests**: Include tests for new functionality
- **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation
- **Breaking Changes**: Clearly mark any breaking changes

### Commit Message Format

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Test additions or modifications
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

Examples:

```

## Issue Reporting

### Bug Reports

When reporting bugs, please include:

- **Environment details**: OS, Python version, package versions
- **Steps to reproduce**: Clear steps to reproduce the issue
- **Expected behavior**: What you expected to happen
- **Actual behavior**: What actually happened
- **Error messages**: Full error messages and stack traces

For feature requests, please include:

- **Use case**: Describe the problem you're trying to solve
- **Proposed solution**: Your ideas for implementation
- **Alternatives**: Alternative solutions you've considered
- **Additional context**: Any other relevant information

## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

- `main`: Stable release branch
- `develop`: Development branch for next release
- `feature/*`: Feature development branches
- `hotfix/*`: Critical bug fix branches

### Release Process

1. Features are developed in `feature/*` branches
2. Features are merged to `develop` via pull requests
3. Release candidates are created from `develop`
4. Stable releases are merged to `main` and tagged

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src/qmnn

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_core.py

# Run tests with specific markers
pytest -m "not slow"
```

### Test Categories

- **Unit tests**: Test individual components
- **Integration tests**: Test component interactions
- **Benchmark tests**: Performance and scaling tests
- **Slow tests**: Long-running tests (marked with `@pytest.mark.slow`)

### Writing Tests

- Place tests in the `tests/` directory
- Use descriptive test names
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Mock external dependencies
- Use fixtures for common test data

## Documentation

### Types of Documentation

- **API Documentation**: Docstrings in code
- **User Guide**: Usage examples and tutorials
- **Developer Guide**: Development and contribution information
- **Paper Documentation**: LaTeX documentation in `paper/`

### Building Documentation

```bash
