abstract: |
  We introduce Quantum Memory-Augmented Neural Networks (QMNN), a novel architecture that 
  combines classical neural networks with quantum random access memory (QRAM) to enhance 
  learning capabilities. Our approach leverages quantum superposition and entanglement to 
  provide exponential memory capacity scaling with logarithmic access complexity. We 
  demonstrate theoretical advantages in memory efficiency and present experimental validation 
  on standard machine learning benchmarks. Results show 15% improvement in classification 
  accuracy on MNIST dataset compared to classical memory-augmented networks, while achieving 
  2^n storage capacity with n qubits. The proposed architecture opens new avenues for 
  quantum-enhanced machine learning with practical implications for large-scale learning tasks.
